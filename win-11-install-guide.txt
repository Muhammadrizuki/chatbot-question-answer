To install Windows 11, first make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements: a 64-bit processor with at least 1GHz and 2 cores, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, UEFI with Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, a DirectX 12-compatible graphics card, and a display with at least 720p resolution. You can verify this using Microsoft’s PC Health Check Tool. Once confirmed, create a bootable USB drive by downloading the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft’s official Windows 11 download page. Run the tool, select "USB flash drive," and let it prepare your installation media. Next, insert the USB into the target PC, restart it, and enter the Boot Menu (usually by pressing F2, F12, ESC, or DEL) to boot from the USB. When the Windows 11 setup screen appears, select your language and preferences, then click "Install Now." Enter your product key if prompted, or skip if you want to activate later. Choose the "Custom" installation option, delete any existing partitions if necessary (this will erase all data), and select the drive where Windows should be installed. The installation process will begin. Once it's done, follow the on-screen instructions to set up your region, Wi-Fi, Microsoft account, privacy settings, and PIN. After completing these steps, you’ll be taken to the Windows 11 desktop—installation complete and ready to use.
